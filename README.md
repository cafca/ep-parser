# EP Amendments Parser

A command-line tool that extracts structured data from European Parliament committee amendment PDFs into machine-readable JSON. Tested against JURI, IMCO, ENVI, and TRAN committee documents; applicable to any EP committee amendment document sharing the same two-column layout.

## Background

EP amendment PDFs present text in a two-column table: the left column contains the original legislative text, and the right column contains the proposed replacement. Each amendment block opens with a bold `Amendment N` header, lists one or more authors, identifies the affected section, and closes with a language marker such as `Or. en`. This tool parses that structure via coordinate-based span analysis rather than relying on PDF table extraction, which is unreliable for this document class.

## Requirements

Python 3.9 or later. The only runtime dependency is PyMuPDF:

```
pip install pymupdf
```

## Usage

```
python parse_amendments.py <input.pdf> [-o output.json]
```

Progress is written to stderr; the JSON output goes to the file specified by `-o` (default: `amendments.json`).

## Output format

Each amendment is represented as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "Amendment 42",
  "authors": "Jane Smith; on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group",
  "section": "Motion for a resolution / Recital A",
  "content": "whereas the existing framework...",
  "amendment": "whereas a revised framework...",
  "warnings": []
}
```

`content` holds the original text from the left column; `amendment` holds the proposed text from the right column. When an amendment proposes a deletion the right column typically contains only the word `deleted` and `content` is empty where the original is new text.

The `warnings` array is empty for cleanly parsed amendments. Non-empty values indicate reliability concerns:

| Warning | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `non_sequential_id` | Amendment number is not sequential — possible missed block |
| `missing_author` | No author line detected between header and section label |
| `both_columns_empty` | Both columns produced no text |
| `suspiciously_short_column` | A column is non-empty but under 3 characters |
| `no_language_marker` | Amendment ended without an `Or. xx` marker |
| `ambiguous_column_split` | One or more spans fell in the boundary zone (x 220–300 pt) |
| `footer_text_leaked` | Document code pattern found in extracted text |

## How it works

Parsing proceeds in four phases.

**Phase 1 — Span extraction.** PyMuPDF's `get_text("dict")` yields every typographic span with its bounding-box origin, font size, and bold flag. Spans below y = 760 pt (the true footer row sits at y ≈ 771) and spans with font size ≥ 20 pt (the large `EN` watermark) are discarded.

**Phase 2 — Line assembly.** Spans on the same page whose y-coordinates are within 2 pt of each other are merged into a single logical line, ordered left to right by x-coordinate.

**Phase 3 — State machine.** A linear pass over the assembled lines drives a state machine through the states `PREAMBLE → AUTHORS → TABLE_BODY`. A bold line matching `Amendment \d+` at font size ≥ 11 pt starts a new amendment. Subsequent bold lines are classified as author names or section identifiers based on whether they contain known structural keywords (`Motion for a resolution`, `Proposal`, `Recital`, `Article`, etc.). The transition to `TABLE_BODY` is triggered by the first line that contains any span in the right-column zone (x ≥ 244 pt); this handles all known column-header variants (`Motion for a resolution / Amendment`, `Text proposed by the Commission / Amendment`, `Proposal for rejection`) as well as documents where no explicit header row is present. Within the table body each span is assigned to `content` (x < 244 pt) or `amendment` (x ≥ 244 pt). An `Or. xx` language marker closes the block.

**Phase 4 — Output.** Accumulated text is joined, heuristic checks are applied, and the result is serialised as a JSON array.

## Coordinate reference (A4, ~595 × 842 pt)

| Zone | x range |
|---|---|
| Left column (original text) | 71 – 244 pt |
| Column gap | 244 – 315 pt |
| Right column (amendment text) | 315 – 530 pt |
| Footer row | y ≈ 771 pt |

## Limitations

The parser assumes the coordinate layout shared by JURI, IMCO, ENVI, and TRAN committee documents generated by the EP's document system (left column at x ≈ 71–244 pt, right column at x ≈ 315–530 pt). Documents produced by different software or with significantly different margins may require adjusting the constants at the top of `parse_amendments.py`. Multi-page amendments where the amendment header falls at the very bottom of a page (forcing an author-line page break) are handled correctly; however, other unusual page-break positions may occasionally cause a section identifier to be misclassified as an author or vice versa.
